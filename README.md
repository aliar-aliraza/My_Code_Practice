# My_Code_Practice

Welcome to my practice repository!  

This repository is dedicated to my coding practice and learning journey. Here, I post small projects and exercises that I create myself, without using AI assistance. The goal is to improve my programming skills through hands-on practice.  

## Languages I Use
- C++
- Java
- Python
- Kotlin
- JavaScript

I plan to add more languages and folders in the future as I continue learning. Projects in this repository are simple and focused on fundamental concepts, allowing me to strengthen my understanding of each language.  

Feel free to explore and learn along with me!
